# About


Welcome to the Entropy Station.

In the endless torrent of technology, the pursuit of knowledge and creation is a discipline against forgetting and chaos.

I am an engineer focused on High-Performance Computing (HPC), the Linux Kernel, and Distributed Systems. These complex fields are my practice ground and my source of inspiration.

This site is my notebookâ€”a place where I attempt to forge scattered thoughts into structured words.

May we all find something valuable on this anti-entropic journey.
